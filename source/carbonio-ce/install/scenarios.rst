 Installation Scenarios
========================

This section currently features two installation scenarios: a
**Single-Server**, with all Roles installed on the same Node and a
**Multi-Server**, which is suitable for small infrastructure. The
*Single-Server* can be installed using a bash script included in the
Scenario's description, while in the *Multi-Server*, each Role must be
installed manually.

If you plan to install and use the :ref:`role-vs-install`, you should
consider deploying the *Multi-Server* scenario, because the |vs|
requires a considerable amount of resources.
