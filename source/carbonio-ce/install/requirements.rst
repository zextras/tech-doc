.. _carbonio-requirements:

Requirements
------------

|product| can be installed in Single-Server or Multi-Server, with the
various services and **Components** spread across two or more **Nodes**.

Requirements are divided into groups: :ref:`system-requirements`,
:ref:`software-requirements`, :ref:`rhel-requirements`, and
:ref:`more-requirements`.

To make requirements easier to understand, we provide software
requirements for a **Node**, which is either the only server used in a
Single-Server or each server in a Multi-Server infrastructure.

.. _system-requirements:

System Requirements for a Node

         "RAM", "16 GB min., 32+ GB recommended"
         "Disk space (operating system and |product|)", "50 GB"

      These requirements are valid for each Node in a |product|
      Installation and may vary depending on the size of the
      infrastructure, which includes the services running on each node
      and the number and size of each mailbox. This means that if for
      example you plan to assign a *10GB* quota to each of your *20
      users*, you must increase the Disk space requirements
      accordingly, i.e., to around 250GB total.

.. _software-requirements:

Software Requirements for a Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|product| is available for **64-bit** CPUs only and can be installed
on top of any of these vanilla distributions:

* **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server Edition**: choose *Ubuntu Server*, not
  *Ubuntu Server (minimized)*
* **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server Edition**: choose *Ubuntu Server*, not
  *Ubuntu Server (minimized)*
* **RHEL 8** (see :ref:`specific requirements <rhel8-req>`)
* **RHEL 9** (see :ref:`specific requirements <rhel9-req>`)

Support for other distributions will be announced in due course
when it becomes available.

.. card:: Installation on Other Linux Distributions

   While they are **not officially supported**, Linux distributions
   compatible with Ubuntu (e.g., Debian) and RHEL (e.g., AlmaLinux,
   Rocky Linux) *may be used* as base OS for |product|, provided all
   dependencies can be satisfied. This may include adding third-party
   repositories or manually installing software packages.

   Moreover, even if |product| can be installed on an unsupported
   distribution, it may require some additional effort to have all
   |product| Components working, for example to manually edit some
   configuration file, while some Component may be not working at
   all. If you face some problems on unsupported distributions or if
   you successfully installed |product| on a unsupported distribution
   and want to share your result, you may want to join the `Official
   Community Forum <https://community.zextras.com/forum>`_.

The following requirements must be satisfied before attempting to
install |product|.

#. The whole |product| infrastructure must have at least **one public
   IP address**. You need to create a DNS **A record** that resolves
   to the public IP (e.g., ``A mail.example.com``)

   .. hint:: You can check a domain's A record using the CLI utility
      ``host``:

      .. code:: console

         # host -t A mail.example.com

#. To allow the mail server to receive mail, it will be necessary to
   set up an **MX record**, which must correspond to the A record
   (e.g. MX: example.com = mail.example.com )

   .. hint:: You can check a domain's MX record using the CLI utility
      ``host``:

      .. code:: console

         # host -t MX example.com

   If either of the ``A`` or ``MX`` records is not correctly
   configured, the installation will be temporarily suspended to allow
   the change of the hostname.
   
#. Each Node must be able to carry out DNS resolution autonomously and
   be able to resolve all other Nodes

#. For improved security of sending emails, you should also define TXT
   records for SPF, DKIM and DMARC

#. Python 3, latest version available on the chosen Operating System

#. Perl, latest version available on the chosen Operating System

#. Make sure that the :file:`/etc/hosts` does not contain any IPv6
   entries

#. Locale settings: |product| requires strictly ``en_US.UTF-8`` as the
   default system locale; a different locale may lead to unexpected
   issues and services not working correctly. Please follow the
   procedure described in Section :ref:`locale-settings` to modify the
   configuration.

.. note:: Only |product| Components should be installed on a |product|
   Node. Installing additional software is unsupported and may cause
   conflicts that could compromise |product|â€™s correct
   functioning. For example, software like Webmin, Cockpit, or Postfix
   may be using the same ports as |product|, therefore interfering
   with its everyday use.


.. _rhel-requirements:

RHEL Specific Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: If you plan to install |product| automatically on a
   *Single-Server* using the downloadable script (see Section
   :ref:`single-install-auto`), these requirements are checked and
   automatically enabled if missing.

.. include:: /_includes/_installation/preliminary-rh-ce.rst

.. _more-requirements:
   
Additional Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you do not use the :ref:`script-based installation
<single-install-auto>`, i.e., Single-Server manual installation or
Multi-Server installation.

* All ``carbonio`` commands must be executed as the ``zextras`` user
  (these commands will feature a ``zextras$`` prompt), while all other
  commands must be issued as the ``root`` user, unless stated
  otherwise.
  
  .. note:: The ``zextras`` user is created during the |product|
     installation process, it is not necessary to create it
     beforehand.
     
* Commands or groups of commands may be different between Ubuntu and
  RHEL 8. This is shown by blue tabs: click on the tab of your choice
  to find the correct command.

* When no such tabs are given, the commands to run are the same on
  Ubuntu and RHEL 8.

.. _fw-ports:

Firewall Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |ce| to operate properly, it is necessary to allow network
communication on specific ports. On a Single-Server installation, only
ports in the *External Connections* must be opened, because all the
remaining traffic does not leave the server.

In Multi-Server installation, ports listed in the *Internal
Connections* must be opened on **all** nodes, while those in the
*External Connections* only on the node on which the corresponding
Component is installed. For example, port 443 should be opened only on the
node hosting the **Proxy** Component.

Furthermore, ports in Internal and External connections are grouped
according to the Component that require them, so all ports listed in a
table must be opened only on the Node on which the Component is installed.

.. card:: Outgoing Traffic

   Carbonio requires no specific ports to communicate with the
   Internet (outgoing traffic), unless you want push notifications to
   be sent to mobile devices. In this case, the Node installing the
   Mailstore & Provisioning Component must be able to communicate with the
   URL **https://notifications.zextras.com/firebase/** on port **443**.

.. _fw-external:

External Connections
++++++++++++++++++++

These ports must be forwarded to the Node installing each Component, to
allow communication with remote services on the Internet.
