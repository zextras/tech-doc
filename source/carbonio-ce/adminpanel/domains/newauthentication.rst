Authentication Methods
======================

The :ref:`component-mesh-install` Component, which installs an *OpenLDAP
service*, is employed by |product| for user authentication and account
management.

|Product| has the ability to use multiple authentication
mechanisms. The authentication type can be set independently for each
domain defined in the |product| infrastructure.  Each of them can be
managed from CLI or |adminui|: please follow the cross references
given to configure each of the methods.

#. **Carbonio**. This is the default authentication method, which is
   equivalent to the *Local LDAP*.

#. **Local LDAP**. The internal authentication method assumes that the
   LDAP scheme is running on the |product| server where the *Directory
   Server* Component is installed.

#. **External LDAP**. The external LDAP authentication method allows
   to connect to an LDAP server, possibly external to the |product|
   infrastructure, using a username and password existing in the
   external database. See how to configure it :ref:`by CLI <ldap-cli>`
   or :ref:`by GUI <ap-ext-ldap>`.

#. **External Active Directory**. The external Active Directory
   authentication method involves the use of Microsoft Active
   Directory services for authentication and |Product|'s Directory
   Server services for all other transactions. See how to configure it
   :ref:`by CLI <ad-cli>` or :ref:`by GUI <ap-ext-ad>`.

Both the *External LDAP* and *External Active Directory* have as their
main requirement that users exist on both servers. Please refer to
Sections :ref:`auth-ext-ldap` and :ref:`auth-ext-ad` respectively for
configuration details.
