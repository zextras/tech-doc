All the resources used for |wl| must have a **valid URI** and must be
reachable from |carbonio|.

In case the resources are hosted on an server external to the
|carbonio| infrastructure, make sure that server's SSL certificate is
valid and has not expired, and its FQDN is valid and resolvable from
|carbonio| (from the Proxy Node in case of a Multi-Server).

You can safely use the |carbonio|'s Proxy Node to expose those
resources, by uploading them into, as the |ru|, a directory called for
example :file:`/opt/zextras/web/custom/` (create it if does not exist
yet) and using the URL ``https://<Carbonio_hostname>/static/custom/``,
where ``<Carbonio_hostname>`` is the FQDN of the node that hosts the
Proxy Component.

Moreover, in a Multi-Server featuring multiple Proxy Nodes, it is
mandatory to keep in sync the resources on all the Proxies instances.
