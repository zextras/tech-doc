A Resource is a generic object that can be assigned an e-mail address,
but, unlike other regular accounts, they do not need any signature, so
you can not specify one.

A Resource can be of type **Meeting Room** or **Equipment** and is
used to book either of them and let colleagues know the it is not
available. There is no strict definition of *Equipment*: it can be any
type of (mobile) furniture, like for example a projector or a company car.

Each resource is associated to an e-mail address: When a Resource is
needed, you can create an appointment and invite the Resource.

A policy can be assigned to Resource, to determine how to react to the
booking request, either a manual or automatic acceptance or
rejection. In particular, it is possible to configure a Resource to
automatically decline recurrent appointments: in this case, the
Resource will not be available if the appointment involving it is
recurrent.

Additional e-mail addresses can be added to the resource, for example
to notify the company's facility manager which meeting rooms are
reserved and which are free.
