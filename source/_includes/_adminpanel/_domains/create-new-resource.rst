.. card:: Step 2. Define Resource

   Fill in all the necessary information. In this example, we create
   a *projector*, which is a piece of equipment. Its
   recurrent use is not allowed, which means it must be reserved each
   time. As a policy, the projector is reserved if not already
   booked, otherwise it will not be possible to reserve it.  The
   projector is also automatically assigned an e-mail address

.. card:: Step 3. Share the Resource

   You can choose to add an e-mail address that will allow someone to
   receive the requests for projector booking as well.
