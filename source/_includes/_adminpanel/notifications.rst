The **Notifications** panel provides a centralized view of system notifications generated by Carbonio services.
These notifications inform administrators about informational events, warnings, errors, and critical conditions
occurring across the infrastructure.

The panel is designed to help administrators quickly identify relevant events, assess their severity, and take
appropriate actions when required.

Notifications List
------------------

The main section of the panel displays a **Notifications List** in the form of a table.
Each row represents a single notification generated by a Carbonio component or service.

The table includes the following columns:

- **Server**  
  The hostname of the server where the notification originated.  

- **Date**  
  The date and time when the notification was generated.

- **Type**  
  The severity level of the notification. Possible values include:

  - **Information** – Informational events that do not require action  
  - **Warning** – Potential issues that may require attention  
  - **Error** – Errors affecting a service or operation  
  - **Critical** – Severe conditions that require immediate attention  

- **Subject**  
  A short description summarizing the event or issue that triggered the notification  
  (for example, *Carbonio Advanced License Disabled*). 

View Notifications by Type
--------------------------

The Notifications panel offers a set of predefined views that group notifications by their type.
Each view displays a dedicated subset of messages, allowing administrators to quickly focus on specific
categories such as informational events, warnings, or errors.

The available views are:

* **All** – Displays all notifications, regardless of their type.
* **Information** – Shows informational notifications related to standard system activities.
* **Warning** – Displays notifications that highlight potential issues requiring attention.
* **Error** – Shows notifications generated by errors or failed operations.

By switching between these views, administrators can easily assess the system status and concentrate on
relevant notifications based on their severity.

Use Cases
---------

The Notifications panel is commonly used to:

- Monitor system health and service activity
- Identify failures or misconfigurations
- Track backup operations and maintenance tasks
- Detect license-related issues
- Review warnings before they escalate into errors

By regularly reviewing notifications, administrators can proactively maintain the stability and reliability
of the Carbonio infrastructure.
