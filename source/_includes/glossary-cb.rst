   HSM
      The **Hierarchical Storage Management** allows to move data
      between different stores according to policies defined by the
      Administrator.

   HSM policy
      An **HSM policy** is a rule that describes how to process an
      item in |product|. A common use is bulk moving items between a
      primary and secondary Volume.

   Primary Volume
      The **Primary store** is the main storage device of
      |product|. Here all data are placed when they arrive (e-mail
      messages) or are created (documents, contacts, and other items).
      It is usually a fast but expensive device, since its purpose is
      the everyday operations of |product| users.

   Secondary Volume
     The **Secondary Volume** is an additional storage device used by
     |product|. Its purpose is to store older items and data, which
     are seldomly accessed. It is a slow storage device

   Delegated Admin
   Delegated Administrator
     A **Delegated Administrator** is a user with specific
     administrative permissions assigned to them, allowing them to
     manage certain aspects of Carbonio without granting them full
     permissions.

     Example scenarios in which *delegated administrators* prove
     useful include: A University that allows allow each department
     head to manage email accounts for the department's staff and
     students; an enterprise sets up for each subsidiary a delegated
     administrator to handle user creation and resource management.

   Object Storage
     The **Object Storage** is a storage technique that manages data
     as blocks (the "object") instead of using a traditional file
     system. This approach allows to store binary data that are
     written once but read often and is used when dealing with large
     collections of unstructured data.

   Trusted Network
     A **Trusted Network** is used in conjunction with 2FA to define
     some networks or IP ranges to allow users to connect using
     username and password, but without requiring the second factor.

   Trusted Device
     A **trusted device** refers to the browser used for login or to the
     device used with mobile app
