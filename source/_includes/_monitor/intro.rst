Monitoring is the process of continuously observing the health, performance, and
status of a system over time by collecting and analysing metrics and logs.
Effective monitoring is essential to ensure reliability, quickly detect and
resolve issues, and optimise performance.  

|product| includes native monitoring components and integrations that allow
administrators to track system behaviour, inspect log files, manage critical
services such as the MTA, and enable alerting and notifications. A properly
functioning |product| infrastructure relies on several core services, including
Directory Server, Consul and PostgreSQL, all of which
contribute to system observability.
