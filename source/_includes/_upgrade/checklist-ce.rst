The upgrade to |version| impacts the following *Components*, packages, or
software, which require some manual interaction before, during, or
after the procedure.

.. card:: Ubuntu Release 22.04 and RHEL 9 |beta|

   |product| |version| can be installed on **Ubuntu 22.04** and **RHEL
   9** (|beta| support).

   If you plan to upgrade to RHEL 9, make sure to satisfy the
   :ref:`specific requirements <rhel9-req>`.

   To upgrade to *Ubuntu 22.04* or *RHEL 9*, follow the procedure
   described in section :ref:`upgrade-os`.
   
.. card:: PostgreSQL 16 support

   PostgreSQL can be upgraded from version **12** to version
   **16**. This step is **mandatory** if you also plan to upgrade from
   *Ubuntu 20.04* to **Ubuntu 22.04** or from **RHEL 8** to **RHEL
   9**, because version 12 is no longer available on Ubuntu
   22.04. Please follow the instructions in section :ref:`pg-upgrade`.

.. card:: Package conflict

   Due to a new package installed, you will see a conflict between the
   installed package ``config-generator`` and the new
   ``service-discover-template`` package on both RHEL and Ubuntu. To
   fix this conflict, before upgrading, you need to remove the
   existing package and install the new one. You can do this with the
   following commands

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Ubuntu
         :sync: ubuntu

         .. code:: console

            # apt install service-discover-template

      .. tab-item:: RHEL
         :sync: rhel

         .. code:: console

            # rpm -e --nodeps config-generator

   Right after the command completes, proceed with the upgrade.

.. card:: |monit|

   During the upgrade of Prometheus, you will be notified of a
   conflict in a file and asked for a solution. Please refer to
   Section :ref:`upgrade-monit` below for directions.

.. card:: |wsc|

   The message dispatcher must be reinitialised after the successful
   |product| upgrade.  Please refer to Section :ref:`upgrade-wsc`
   below for directions.
