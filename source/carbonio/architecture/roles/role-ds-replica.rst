Directory Replica
=================

Preliminaries
-------------

Before attempting to install the Directory Replica Component, please read
carefully the whole procedure in this page and make sure **all** the
following requirements are satisfied.

* A |product| infrastructure is already operating correctly

* A new Node is available, on which to install the Replica, which
  satisfies the :ref:`carbonio-requirements` and on which the
  :ref:`preliminary` have already been executed

  .. note:: You can also install the Replica on an existent Node, but
     not on the same Node which features the Primary Directory Component.

* Pay attention that some commands **must be executed** as the
  ``zextras`` user, while other as the ``root`` user

* Give the new node a meaningful name/FQDN. We will use
  `ds-replica.example.com` whenever necessary. Remember to replace it
  with the name you give.

* Have CLI access to the Main and Replica, as you need to execute
  commands on both servers

.. _replica-installation:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installation requires to execute install these packages on the
Node on which you plan to install the Directory Replica Component.

.. include:: /_includes/_installation/_packages/role-ds-replica.rst

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring the Directory Replica server requires a few steps. Make
sure to execute the commands on the Master or Replica, as shown in each
step description.

.. card:: Step 1: Activate replica on Master

   Activate the replica by executing as the  ``zextras`` user

   .. code:: console

      # /opt/zextras/libexec/zmldapenablereplica

.. card:: Step 2: Retrieve passwords on Master

   Retrieve the passwords that you will need on the Directory Replica,
   using the ``zextras`` user

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmlocalconfig -s zimbra_ldap_password

   .. note:: In case you have changed the passwords of the other LDAP
      services (replication, postfix, amavis, and nginx), retrieve
      also the following passwords, using :command:`zmlocalconfig`:
      ``ldap_replication_password``, ``ldap_postfix_password``
      `ldap_amavis_password``, ``ldap_nginx_password``.

.. card:: Step 3: Bootstrap |product| on Directory Replica

   You need to configure a number of options to successfully bootstrap
   |carbonio|: they are listed in the next step. First, start the
   process by running as the ``root`` user

   .. code:: console

      # carbonio-bootstrap

.. card:: Step 4: Configure the Directory Replica

   You will asked to properly configure a couple of options in the
   `Common configuration` and `Ldap configuration` menus. In the first
   menu, provide these values:

   .. parsed-literal::

      Ldap configuration

         1) Hostname: The hostname of the *Director Replica* Node.
         2) Ldap master host: The hostname of the *Mesh & Directory* Node
         3) Ldap port: 389
         4) Ldap Admin password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``

   Exit this menu and go to the second:

   .. parsed-literal::

      Ldap configuration

         1) Status: ``Enabled``
         2) Create Domain: do not change
         3) Domain to create: example.com
         4) Ldap root password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``
         5) Ldap replication password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``
         6) Ldap postfix password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``
         7) Ldap amavis password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``
         8) Ldap nginx password: The ``zimbra_ldap_password``

   .. hint:: If on the Mesh & Directory Node you configured
      different password than ``zimbra_ldap_password`` for 5), 6), 7),
      and 8), make sure you provide the correct passwords.

.. card:: Step 5: Complete the installation

   You can now continue the bootstrap process and after a while the
   installation will be successfully completed and immediately after,
   the Mesh & Directory's data will be copied over to the Directory
   Replica on the new Node.

Testing
~~~~~~~

In order to test whether the Directory Replica works correctly after the
installation was completed successfully, you can make a quick test as
follows.

#. Log in to the *Mesh & Directory* Node and create a test user with
   a password

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ carbonio prov ca john.doe@example.com MySecretPassword

#. Log in to the *Directory Replica* and check that all accounts have
   been copied over from the Mesh & Directory:

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ carbonio prov -l gaa

   Among the results, the `john.doe@example.com` must be present.

   .. hint:: You can pipe the previous command to ``grep`` to check
      only the new account (or any given account): :command:`carbonio
      prov -l gaa | grep "john.doe@example.com"`

#. On the *Directory Replica*, execute command

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ /opt/zextras/libexec/zmreplchk

   If everything is working correctly, the output of the command will
   be similar to::

     Replica: ldap://ds-replica.example.com:389 Code: 0 Status: In Sync CSNs:
     20240129112059.968930Z#000000#000#000000

Set up Directory Replica to Answer Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now time to configure the Directory Replica to answer queries:
this requires to reconfigure the value of the ``ldap_url`` parameter
and let it point to the Directory Replica. You can achieve this set up
with a few commands on the **Mesh & Directory**.

#. Stop all |product| services

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmcontrol stop

#. Update the value of ``ldap_url``.

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmlocalconfig -e \
        ldap_url="ldap://ds-replica.example.com:389 \
        ldap://srv1.example.com:389"

   .. note:: `srv1.example.com` is the FQDN of the node which installs
      the *Mesh & Directory* Component

   If you plan to install multiple Directory Replicas, you can install
   all of them and then execute the above-mentioned command once for
   all Replicas, making sure that their hostnames precede the **Mesh
   and Directory hostname**. For example, provided you installed two
   Replica Directory Servers on ``ds1-replica.example.com`` and
   ``ldap://ds2-replica.example.com``, execute:

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmlocalconfig -e \
        ldap_url="ldap://ds1-replica.example.com:389 \
        ldap://ds2-replica.example.com:389 \
        ldap://srv1.example.com:389"

   The Directory Replica instance to query first is the first listed
   in the command.

.. _ds-replica-stop:

Deactivate a Directory Replica
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a Directory Replica, you need to carry out two tasks:

#. On **each node** of the installation, execute the following
   command

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmlocalconfig -e ldap_url="ldap://srv1.example.com:389"

   In case you had configured multiple Directory Replicas, the above
   command will redirect all queries to the Mesh & Directory
   Node. If you want to remove only some of the Directory Replicas,
   list all hostnames except the one you want to remove. For example,
   to remove ldap://ds2-replica.example.com, use the command

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmlocalconfig -e \
        ldap_url="ldap://ds1-replica.example.com:389 \
        ldap://srv1.example.com:389"

#. Execute, **only on the MTA node** the command

   .. code:: console

      # /opt/zextras/libexec/zmmtainit

   This command will update the configuration of postfix with new ``ldap_url``.
