Introducing systemd as new Carbonio init system
===============================================

Starting with Carbonio 25.6.0, systemd will become the default service manager on
supported distributions RHEL 9 and Ubuntu 24.04.
This page walks through the motivations for this change, what systemd brings
to the table, how itâ€™s been implemented in Carbonio, and how system administrators
can interact with the new system.

Why Move to systemd?
====================
After evaluating the current init system and its limitations, the Zextras team
identified key opportunities for improvement that systemd helps address:

**Faster Boot with Parallel Service Startup**
systemd starts services concurrently, drastically reducing the boot time.
This ensures faster system availability and responsiveness crucial for enterprise-grade
collaboration platforms like Carbonio.

**Smarter Dependency Handling**
systemd precisely tracks service dependencies, starting them in the correct order.
This reduces race conditions, startup errors, and enhances reliability.

**Unified and Simplified Service Configuration**
All services are managed via standardized unit files. This unification simplifies service
configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

**Built-in Service Monitoring**
systemd offers native mechanisms for service supervision, auto-restarts, logging (journalctl)
and fine-grained resource control.

**On-Demand Service Activation**
With socket activation support, systemd allows services to start only when needed, improving
performance and reducing memory usage.

**Future-Proof Architecture**
systemd is container and microservice friendly, positioning Carbonio for modern infrastructure
deployments and easier scaling.

**Community and Ecosystem**
With robust community support, up-to-date documentation, and active development, systemd ensures
Carbonio remains aligned with modern Linux standards.
