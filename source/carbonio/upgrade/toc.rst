================================
 Upgrade to |product| |release|
================================

This section contains the upgrade procedures to the latest |carbonio|
release from the latest and the most recent previous releases
(:ref:`24.12 <carbonio-upgrade>`, :ref:`24.9 <up-249>`, and :ref:`24.7
<up-247>`), the changelogs of recent and
older releases, and any security advice, if present.

|product| does not have any installer: whenever new versions are
released, the |zx| repositories are updated and packages are available
for installation along with the other system updates. Therefore, the
upgrade procedure is usually a very quick activity, carried out by
means of a few commands to be executed.

.. hint:: The upgrade procedure are independent of any specific patch
   numbers: i.e., to upgrade from *24.7.0* and *24.7.1*, you need to
   follow the same procedure.

Before starting an upgrade procedure, it is strongly suggested to make
a snapshot of the Nodes and a backup of the data.
