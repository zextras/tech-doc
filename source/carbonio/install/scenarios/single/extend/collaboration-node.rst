.. warning:: Please pay attention to **Step 4**: the installation
   command needs to be executed on the **Core Node**.

.. dropdown:: Step 1: Configuration of Repositories

   .. rubric:: |product|

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/step-repo-conf.rst

   .. rubric:: PostgreSQL

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/_repo/pg.rst

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/steps-hostname.rst

.. dropdown:: Step 3: System Upgrade and Package Installation

   After configuring the repositories, the installation of |product|
   requires to run a few commands.

   We start by updating and upgrading the system.

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/pkg-upgrade.rst

   Next, we install all packages needed for |product|.

   Login to the *Core Node* and install the following packages.

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Ubuntu 22.04
         :sync: ubu22

         .. code:: console

            # apt install carbonio-ws-collaboration-ui \

         .. code:: console

            # apt install carbonio-ws-collaboration-ui \
            carbonio-tasks-ui

.. dropdown:: Step 5: Bootstrap |product|

   To carry out this step, you need the **LDAP password** and the
   **Node hostname** that you have retrieved at Step 9 of the Core
   Node (see :ref:`Step 9 <n1-s9>`).

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/step-bootstrap.rst

.. dropdown:: Step 5: Setup |mesh|

   To carry out this step, you need the |mesh| **secret** generated
   during the installation of the Core Node (see :ref:`Step 9
   <n1-s9>`).

   The |mesh| configuration is interactively generated by command

   .. code:: console

      # service-discover setup-wizard

   To complete |mesh| installation, run

   .. code:: console

      # pending-setups -a

.. dropdown:: Step 6: Configure |WSC|

   .. rubric:: Initialise the message dispatcher

   To carry out this step, you need the **PostgreSQL bootstrap**
   password that you defined during the installation of the Core Node
   (see in :ref:`Step 9 <n1-s9>` how to retrieve it).

   .. code:: console

      # read -s -p "Insert Password:" DB_ADM_PWD

   Now, run command

   .. include:: /_includes/_installation/_components/dispatcher-migration.rst

   .. rubric:: Enable |wsc|

   |wsc| can be enabled from the |adminui| at account or COS level:
   please refer to Sections :ref:`Account / Configuration <act-conf>` and
   :ref:`cos-features`, respectively.

   .. hint:: If the |wsc| installation is successful, you can optimise
      some values according to the guidelines that you can find in
      section :ref:`wsc-optimise`.

   .. rubric:: Status Check

   The following command will output a detailed status of |wsc| and of
   all its dependencies.

   .. code:: console

      # curl -v http://127.78.0.4:10000/health | jq
