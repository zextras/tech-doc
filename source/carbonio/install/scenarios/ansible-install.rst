=================================
 Install |product| Using Ansible
=================================

|product| can be installed automatically by using the *inventory
files*, provided with each installation scenario, with the Ansible
software. The components of a sample |product| installation and their
interaction is depicted in the diagram below.

Prepare Inventory
=================

Download the inventory file corresponding to the scenario that you
want to install (you can find it in the various *Scenarios* page that
follow this one) and place it under a directory of your
choice. Remember to give the inventory file a meaningful name.

The :file:`carbonio_inventory` file contains various sections, one for
each of the available Components. You need to edit the file and provide the
FQDN of the Node on which the Component will be installed. Suppose that you
install on 5 nodes, whose FQDNs are ``srv1.example.com`` to
``srv5.example.com``, an excerpt of the file might look like::

  [postgresServers]
  srv1.example.com

  [masterDirectoryServers]
  srv1.example.com

  [dbsConnectorServers]
  srv1.example.com

If you do not want to install a Component, simply leave the corresponding
section empty.

For some of the Components you need to provide some additional
value for a proper configuration. Currently, these sections are

* the Proxy Component::

    [proxyServers:vars]
    #webmailHostname=webmailPublicHostname

  This is the FQDN of the domain, for example ``mail.example.com``,
  so::

    [proxyServers:vars]
    webmailHostname=mail.example.com

* The |vs|, if installed::

    [videoServers]
    #hostname public_ip_address=x.y.z.t

  In this case, supposing that the Component is installed on
  ``srv5.example.com`` and the public IP address of the |vs| is
  172.16.12.5, this entry should look like::

    [videoServers]
    srv5.example.com public_ip_address=172.16.12.5

  .. note:: 172.16.12.5 is a private IP, remember to replace it with
     an actual public IP!

In order to run the script, first go to the directory in which you
saved the Inventory, then execute either command, depending on the
Scenario.

.. card:: Single-Server Scenario

   .. code:: console

      $ ansible-playbook zxbot.carbonio_ssinstall.carbonio_ssinstall \
      -u root -i carbonio-inventory \
      --extra-vars "install_path=zxbot.carbonio_install.carbonio_install"

.. card:: All other Scenarios

   .. code:: console

      $ ansible-playbook  zxbot.carbonio_install.carbonio_install \
      -u root -i carbonio-inventory

Make sure to replace :file:`carbonio-inventory` with the proper name of the
inventory you want to install.

The playbook will execute all the tasks necessary and print the result
on the screen. When finished, a summary of the results is
displayed. Moreover, the passwords created during the installation are
saved in the directory from which the command was launched, along with
the :file:`carbonio-inventory` file, so you have them always at your
disposal when you need them, for example during upgrades or routine
tasks. To protect them, make sure:

* to allow only trusted persons the access to the directory

* to make a backup of the directory

.. card:: Failed inventory installation

   If for any reason the installation fails, you can check the log
   file (to set it up, see Section :ref:`ansible-conf`) to see what
   happened, fix it, then execute again the inventory. Ansible will
   recognise the steps already successfully carried out and run only
   those that failed.

Closing Remarks
===============

Once the script has successfully completed, you can immediately access
your new |product| installation and execute the first necessary tasks,
see Section :ref:`web-access`. You can then proceed to carry out further
administration tasks, see :ref:`post-install`. In particular, if you plan
to migrate to |product|, refer to section  :ref:`migration`.

.. _ansible-ts:

Troubleshooting Ansible Installation
====================================

While most of the times the |product| installation using Ansible is
flawless, there are a few cases in which a playbook run is not
successful. This can happen for example when communication between the
Control Node, the Nodes, and the repositories fails.

When the playbook does not terminate successfully, the best choice is
to run it again. Even though Ansible can be invoked to run only
selected tasks, due to the nature of |product| installation, manually
running only those tasks may not suffice to successfully complete the
installation.

Moreover, since Ansible features an internal mechanism that, during a
playbook run, keeps track of the tasks that were completed, failed, or
not executed, the best solution is to run the playbook another
time. Indeed, during this second run, only the tasks that failed or
were not executed during the first run are carried out.
