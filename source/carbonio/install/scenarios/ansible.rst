.. _install-with-ansible:

=================================
 Prepare the Ansible Environment
=================================

Section :ref:`components-installation` reviews all the roles that make up
|product| and the tasks required to successfully complete the
installation.

To make the installation process easier and faster, this section
introduces an alternative installation method based on Ansible Galaxy,
an `Ansible playbook
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html>`_, and an Ansible
*inventory file* .

.. note:: Ansible is free software that allows you to automate the
   configuration and management procedures on Unix-like and Windows
   systems.

Ansible will read an `inventory file` containing a list of the Nodes
on which to install the various Components and automatically execute on the
proper Node all the necessary tasks.

Once the **Control Node** (i.e., a workstation with Ansible installed
and from which to launch |product| installations, see Section
:ref:`ansible-setup` below) has been properly set up according the
directions below, the ansible installation only requires to edit the
inventory file and run **one CLI command** to execute the playbook.

.. _ansible-req:

Requirements
============

You can run the Ansible playbook form any control node, which runs
Linux, macOS, or BSD, satisfying the following requirements

.. note:: Using Ansible from a Windows control node is not
   straightforward: If you want to use the Ansible playbook from a
   Windows control node, please read `the official Windows FAQ
   <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_faq.html#windows-faq-ansible>`_
   for setting it up.

.. card:: Control Node requirements

   #. The control node has a working installation of Ansible (see
      Section :ref:`ansible-setup` for directions)

   #. The control node has SSH access as the ``root`` user to all the
      Nodes on which |product| must be installed. This is necessary
      because Ansible needs to install packages and carry out various
      tasks which require root privileges.

      .. hint:: You can temporarily copy the SSH key of the user on
         the control node to the :file:`.ssh/authorized_keys` file of
         the Nodes' ``root`` user

.. card:: Nodes requirements

   Besides the :ref:`carbonio-requirements` that every Node must
   satisfy, each Nodes must

   #. be equipped with the same **supported OS** (see section
      :ref:`software-requirements`)

   #. be able to reach one another via SSH

   #. have the |product| repository configured (see section
      :ref:`preliminary` for directions)

.. _ansible-setup:

Ansible Setup
=============

This section guides you in the set up of a control node featuring
Ansible (the **Control Node**) and the |carbonio| Ansible playbook,
with the purpose to install |product| on an existing infrastructure.

The control node should run on any Linux, macOS, or BSD box. Windows
is supported but needs some work, therefore it is not mentioned
here.

.. _ansible-inst-linux:

Install Ansible - Linux
-----------------------

On Linux, Ansible can be installed using packages in the
distribution's repository, hence using the distribution's package
manager. Please refer to the `official installation guide
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html>`_.
This procedure pulls all the necessary dependencies, including **python3**.

To verify that installation was successful, run the following command
on the control node

.. code:: console

   $ ansible --version

.. _ansible-inst-mac:

Install Ansible - macOS, BSD
----------------------------

The best installation option on these platforms is to use
``homebrew``, provided a **python3** interpreter is installed on the
system. You can follow these `directions
<https://medium.com/javarevisited/how-to-install-ansible-on-mac-2baf00d42466>`_.

Install |carbonio| Playbook
===========================

|product| Playbook is available from Ansible Galaxy in two variants:
one for Single-Server Scenario and one for all other scenarios. You
need to simply run a command to install either of them. The playbooks
are **version-dependant**: to install |product| you will need to use
the corresponding playbook version. Please ensure that you always
have installed the latest playbook to be able to install the most
recent |product| release.

.. card:: Playbook for Single-Server Scenario

   .. code:: console

      # ansible-galaxy collection install zxbot.carbonio_ssinstall

.. card:: Playbook for all other Scenarios

   .. code:: console

      # ansible-galaxy collection install zxbot.carbonio_install

.. _ansible-conf:

Configure Ansible
-----------------

You can configure Ansible using the :file:`ansible.cfg` file.  Please
refer to the `official documentation
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_configuration.html>`_
for directions.


.. _ansible-multi-inventories:

Multiple Inventories
====================

If you plan to install multiple instances of |carbonio| on different
environments, we suggest that you create a dedicated directory to
store the various inventories required for the different setups.

Ansible Glossary
================

.. glossary::
   :sorted:

   
   Collection
      An Ansible collection is a distribution format for Ansible
      content that includes roles, modules, plugins, playbooks, and
      documentation. Collections help organize and distribute Ansible
      content more efficiently, especially for large-scale automation.

   Playbook

      An Ansible Playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks
      to automate IT processes, such as configuring servers, deploying
      applications, or managing network devices. It is a key part of
      Ansibleâ€™s automation framework.

   Inventory
   
      An Ansible Inventory is a file that defines the hosts (servers,
      network devices, etc.) where Ansible will run tasks.  It
      organizes hosts into groups and allows dynamic configuration
      using variables.  The installation mode of Zextras Carbonio
      performed with Ansible uses a static inventory file (INI format)
      that lists hosts and groups.
