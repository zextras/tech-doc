This scenario involves the presence of a single tenant. It builds on
the :ref:`Full Small Scenario <scenario-fullsmall>` by decoupling a
few services and prepare the |product| infrastructure for a future
growth and scalability . This scenario is therefore intended for
infrastructures including hundreds of accounts and are ready to scale
up to tens of thousands of accounts.

The scenario can be deployed
either using the :ref:`scenario-st-playbook`, or :ref:`manually
<scenario-st-manual>`, Node by Node. In both cases, make sure you
:ref:`configure the internal network <scenario-st-network>`.

The Roles installed on the *7 Nodes* are:

* Node 1: Mesh & Directory, Database, and Monitoring
* Node 2: MTA AV/AS
* Node 3: Proxy
* Node 4: Mailstore & Provisioning, and Tasks
* Node 5: WSC, Files
* Node 6: Docs & Editor, Preview
