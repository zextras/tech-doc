About the Documentation
========================

This section contains the changelogs of the |product| Documentation
releases. Since the documentation is released more often than the
software, we keep a list of changes made to the documentation on a
monthly basis, starting from **October 2024**.

Changelogs are divided in two sections:

* **New and Updated Content** contains all the changes done, including
  pieces that have been amended, removed, or have been written from
  scratch

* **Bugfix List** are errors or mistakes introduced in the
  documentation and that have been corrected. For example, because we
  wrote a wrong command.

Each entry in the changelog consists of

* a unique id (e.g., *202410-812*) consisting of a date (year and
  month), and a number (an internal reference to the task)
* a title (e.g., *Move Requirements Before Ansible Upgrade*)
* a description with links to the documentation and the PRs that
  introduced the changes
