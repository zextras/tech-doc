Administrative Roles Explained
==============================

User Accounts created on the Directory Server can be granted some
:term:`rights` to become an **Administrative** account, so they can
manage the rights assigned to other accounts, the settings of a
domain, or a combination of them.

In this page we describe the main pre-built roles
(:ref:`ap-global-admins`, :ref:`ap-domain-admins`,
:ref:`ap-delegated-admins`, :ref:`ap-user-admins`,
:ref:`ap-group-admins`, :ref:`ap-helpdesk-admins`) and their
associated rights. Users that belong to these groups automatically
inherit the rights of the group. Pre-built roles are hierarchical,
meaning that every role has some peculiar right plus all the rights of
the roles below: for example, a Delegated Domain Admin also possesses
all rights of User, Group, and Help Desk Administrators.

Except for the :ref:`ap-global-admins`, who has access to all domains
and setting defined in the |adminui|, all other pre-built roles
allow to manage the settings of one domain or a subset of a domain.

Requirements
------------

These requirements must be satisfied before being able to manage
rights.

#. To be able to use right, a domain must be first initialised from
   :menuselection:`Domains --> Manage --> Delegated Domain Admins`.

   Alternatively, you can initialise a domain from the CLI:

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ carbonio admin initDomainForDelegation example.com

   Replace **example.com** with the domain to initialise.

#. User eligible to become Administrators must have the attribute
   ``zimbraIsDelegationAdminAccount`` set to **True**

.. index:: Domain Initialisation; Error

.. card:: Errors during domain initialisation

   If during the initialisation you see a red pop up in the |adminui|
   or the following error message if you issue the command from the
   CLI::

     Admin Auth Token is missing or empty

   You can fix this problem by deploying again the CA, issuing the
   following command as the ``zextras`` user

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ zmcertmgr deployca

   Then, initialise again the domain

   .. code:: console

      zextras$ carbonio admin initDomainForDelegation example.com

   .. note:: you can also check whether in the log file
      :file:`opt/zextras/mailbox.log` you find the message::

        ERROR [ZxLink Handler Thread] [] extensions -
        javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed:
        sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:
        unable to find valid certification path to requested target

How to Create an Administrator
------------------------------

To create Administrators, the procedure is slightly different between
Global Admins and administrators.

.. card:: Global Administrators

   To set an account as a Global Administrator, go to
   :menuselection:`Domains --> Domain --> Accounts`, select the
   account to promote, and on the `Administration` tab click the
   `Global Administration` switch.

      Adding a Global Administrator.

.. card:: Domain administrators

   To grant an account any other Administrator roles, go to
   :menuselection:`Domains --> Domain --> Accounts`, select the
   account to promote, and on the `Administration` tab click the
   `Delegated Administration` switch, then select the corresponding
   right:

   .. csv-table::
      :header: "Role", "Right"

      "Domain Admin", "``__domain_admins@example.com``"
      "Delegated Admin", "``__delegated_admins@example.com``"
      "User Management Admin", "``__user_admins@example.com``"
      "Group Admin", "``__groups_admins@example.com``"
      "Help Desk Admin", "``__helpdesk_admins@example.com``"
